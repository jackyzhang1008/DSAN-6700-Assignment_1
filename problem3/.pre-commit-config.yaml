    # The repository URL is pointing to Ruff's pre-commit repository, which is designed to work with pre-commit hooks.
    # This is the correct way to use Ruff with pre-commit.
  - repo: https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff-pre-commit # https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff#usage
    rev: 'v0.1.5'  # Adjust to the latest version of Ruff
    hooks:

  # The pre-commit hooks are installed in the .git/hooks/ directory of your Git project. 
  # You wonâ€™t see the .git folder by default because it is a hidden directory.
